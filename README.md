A browser extension to add a proper title to our favorite CSCI 201 professor.

This is a cross-platform, cross-browser extension written using the [WebExtensions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions). That's pretty lit IMO. If you're a big nerd, you might want to look at [the big new cross-platform extension API that's coming](https://browserext.github.io/browserext/).

Add the extension by building from a local copy as explained at these links: 
* [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension)
* [Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked)
* [Opera](https://dev.opera.com/extensions/basics/)
* More to come soon.

Then test it on sample.html in the root of this directory! Also try it on [the USC schedule of classes for Computer Science][schedule], for CSCI 201 and 401.
