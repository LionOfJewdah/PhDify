# PhDify

A collection of browser extensions to add a proper title to our favorite CSCI 201 professor and enhance your USC computer science experience.

These are cross-platform, cross-browser extensions written using the [WebExtensions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions). That's pretty lit IMO. If you're a big nerd, you might want to look at [the big new cross-platform extension API that's coming](https://browserext.github.io/browserext/).

Check the README.md in each extension's subdirectory to see latest development and release versions of the extensions.
