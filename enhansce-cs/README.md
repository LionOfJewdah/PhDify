# PhDify Enhansce

A browser extension to add a proper title to our favorite CSCI 201 professor.

This is a cross-platform, cross-browser extension written using the [WebExtensions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions). That's pretty lit IMO. If you're a big nerd, you might want to look at [the big new cross-platform extension API that's coming](https://browserext.github.io/browserext/).

You can install the latest release versions of the extension from: 
* [Firefox][ffinstall]
* [Chrome][crinstall]
* Opera - coming soon
* More soon

[ffinstall]: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/phdify-append/
[crinstall]: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/phdify-append/cppkjkleemdkhlicoagpijkccnbgkpbp
[opinstall]: https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/phdify-append/?display=en-us


To add the extension by building from a local copy, use these links as a tutorial: 
* [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension)
* [Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked)
* [Opera](https://dev.opera.com/extensions/basics/)
* More to come soon.

Then test it on sample.html in the root of this directory! Also try it on [the USC schedule of classes for Computer Science][schedule], for CSCI 201 and 401.
